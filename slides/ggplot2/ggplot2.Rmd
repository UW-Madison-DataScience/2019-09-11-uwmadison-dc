`tidyverse` installs several packages useful for data analysis such as `tidyr`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tibble`, etc.

Let's load the `tidyverse` including `ggplot2`.

```{r eval=FALSE}

install.packages(tidyverse)

```{r}
# load the tidyverse packages including ggplot2

# **Setup**

We are studying the species repartition and weight of animals caught in plots in our study area.

Let's read in the data using the `read_csv()` function from the `tidyverse` package `readr`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# download the CSV file that contains the survey data from figshare
download.file(url="https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292169",
              destfile = "data/portal_data_joined.csv")

```

```{r}
# load into memory the content of the CSV file as an object of class data.frame
surveys <- read_csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv")

```

# **Presentation of the Survey Data**

| species_id      | 2-letter code                      |
| sex             | Sex of animal (“M”, “F”)           |
| hindfoot_length | Length of the hindfoot in mm       |
| weight          | Weight of the animal in grams      |
| genus           | Genus of animal                    |
| species         | Species of animal                  |

`ggplot2` allows to customize the shape colors thanks to its `fill` and `color` arguments.

- **Name:** R offers about 657 color names. You can read all of them using `colors()`.
- **rgb:** The `rgb()` function allows to build a color using a quantity of red, green and blue. An additionnal parameter is available to set the transparency. All parameters ranged from 0 to 1.
- **Number:** Color can be defined by its number <br> e.g. `colors()[143]`.
- **Hex Code:** Colors can be defined by their hex code <br> e.g. `#69b3a2`. To find the hex code of your dream, visit this color picker.

# **g is for Getting Started**

We start by loading the required packages. `ggplot2` is included in the `tidyverse` package.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

```

```{r eval=FALSE}
surveys_complete <- read_csv("data/surveys_complete.csv")

```

---

# **Challenges**

Use what you just learned to create a scatter plot of `weight over` `species_id` with `plot_types` showing in different colors. Is this a good way to show this type of data?

---

# **Challenges**

<!-- Boxplots are useful summaries, but hide the shape of the distribution. For example, if the distribution is bimodal, we would not see it in a boxplot. An alternative to the boxplot is the violin plot, where the shape (of the density of points) is drawn. -->

<!-- - Replace the box plot with a violin plot; see `geom_violin()`. -->

<!-- In many types of data, it is important to consider the scale of the observations. For example, it may be worth changing the scale of the axis to better distribute the observations in the space of the plot. Changing the scale of the axes is done similarly to adding/modifying other components (i.e., by incrementally adding commands). Try making these modifications: -->

<!-- - Represent weight on the log10 scale; see `scale_y_log10()`. -->

<!-- So far, we’ve looked at the distribution of weight within species. Try making a new plot to explore the distribution of another variable within each species. -->

<!-- - Create a boxplot for `hindfoot_length`. Overlay the boxplot layer on a jitter layer to show actual measurements. -->

<!-- - Add color to the data points on your boxplot according to the plot from which the sample was taken (`plot_id`). -->

<!-- Hint: Check the class for `plot_id`. Consider changing the class of `plot_id` from integer to factor. Why does this change how R makes the graph? -->

Create a visualization displaying a boxplot of `hindfoot_length` for each `species_id`. Modify the plot in the following way.

1. Do not display box plots for species with fewer than 50 total observations
2. Overlay the scatterplot on top of the box plot (`geom_jitter()`)
`geom_jitter()` will "jitter" points left and right, but also "jitter" the y-values of hind foot lengths. This is not good practice because we are actually changing the displayed measured values. Use the `geom_jitter()` option `height` such that "jitter" does not change the displayed hind foot length measurements.
3. Modify the transparency of the scatterplot such that the box plot is still visible. You may choose to change the color as well.
4. Notice that after overlaying the scatterplot, the outliers outside the boxplot are duplicated. Tell ggplot not to display the outliers from `geom_boxplot()`.
 

Hint: You may need to use `dplyr` for the first aim, and search in the options/documentation of `geom_boxplot()` to hide the outliers. Google may be of help too!

# **Challenge**

Use what you just learned to create a plot that depicts how the average weight of each species changes through the years.
